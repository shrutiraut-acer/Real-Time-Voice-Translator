Project Summary: Real-Time Voice Translator
Overview:

The Real-Time Voice Translator is a machine learning project designed to translate spoken language from one language to another in real time. It preserves the tone and emotion of the speaker and outputs the translated text as speech in MP3 format. The application features a user-friendly Tkinter GUI interface for easy interaction.

Key Features:

Real-time speech recognition using Google's speech recognition API.
Translation between multiple languages via Google Translate.
Text-to-speech output using gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech).
Support for a wide range of languages, including English, Hindi, Bengali, Spanish, Chinese (Simplified), Russian, Japanese, Korean, German, French, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Gujarati, and Punjabi.
Multi-threaded processing for efficient CPU usage.
Options to start, stop, and kill the translation process.
